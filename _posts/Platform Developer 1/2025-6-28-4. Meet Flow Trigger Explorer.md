   2. Categorized Flows
      Record-triggered flows are categorized into groups based on **when they execute** relative to the record save operation.
      So, the Flow Trigger Explorer displays the flows in the order they will execute.
      But, within the ==Run Asynchronously group==, we can't guarantee that the flows will run exactly in order listed. 
   3. Status and Detail Panel
      You can activate or deactivate a flow from here.

##### 3. Record Your Flows
   With Flow Trigger Explorer, you can change the order that flows run ==without having to open each flow and change their settings==.


##### 4.  Monitor Your Record-Triggered Flows
   *Time-Based Workflow*  
   *You can use it when you want to see individually scheduled instances of a path that runs in the future.*
