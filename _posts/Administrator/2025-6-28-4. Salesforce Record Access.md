### 1. Record Ownership

###### Levels of Record Access  
![[Pasted image 20250513133535.png|200]]

###### The Omnipotent Admin
**System Admin** : One of the **Standard Profiles** with full access to all org settings and data
Delegated Admin : Limited admin permissions  
Custom Admin : Light version of admin

###### Record Ownership
VESTD(view, edit, share, transfer, delete)

###### Queues
A queue is a holding area for records that are not yet assigned to a specific user.

### 2. Organization-Wide Defaults(OWD)
조직의 기본 설정  
The baseline level of access users have to each other's data.
It defines the **most restrictive sharing settings** before additional sharing mechanisms are applied.
###### Setting Access to Records
- OWD
- Role Hierarchy
- Sharing Rules
- Teams: Allow collaborative access on a record-by-record basis(레코드 단위로 협업 지원)
- Manual Sharing
- Restriction Rules(Think of it as Muting permission)

###### Record Access
Imagine access as **office** entry on a specific floor

###### Organization-Wide Defaults
OWD defines the **default security boundary**  at the org level
(org의 기본 보안 경계선, 처음에 얼마나 개방적으로 설정할 것인지)
- Start with restrictive access
- Open Access with Sharing Rules
- Tighten access with Restriction Rules

###### Sharing Settings 
- Public Model
  No restrictions on record access  
  Default Data Access model  
- **Hybrid Model**
  Public + Private access
  Most commonly used
- Private Model
  Users can only access records that they own.

###### Hands on

Set up -> Security>**Sharing Settings** -> Edit

### 3. Role Hierarchy
역할계층
###### Role Hierarchy
- 수직상속만을 의미하지 않고 + ==데이터 접근의 흐름 설계==
- **Role Hierarchies**(수평적으로도 가능) are not **org charts**(조직도: 상하).
  For example. 
  VP and Managers can be paralleled

###### Implicit Account Access
암시적 계정 접근

- Salesforce automatically grants additional record access to ensure usability.  
  (사용자의 업무 흐름 끊지 않도록 자동 보안 설계)  
- Regardless of role, a user who owns a child record of an account gains Read access on that account.

###### Hands on

User>**Roles** -> Set Up Roles -> Add Role 



### 4. Sharing Rules
(cross-sell: 협업)  
###### Sharing Rules
Used to grant additional record access when OWD is too restrictive.
- Irrelevant for public data access models
- One direction only
- Rules can be based on **ownership** or on **criteria** of records.

###### Public Groups
- A custom grouping of users, roles, or other groups to simplify sharing. #custom
- Prevents the need for many individual sharing rules by grouping users.

###### Hands on
![[Pasted image 20250513174104.png|400]]
Users> **Public Groups** -> New -> ==create new group information==  
Security -> **Sharing Settings** -> choose Opportunities from the Manage sharing settings for: drop-down -> in the **Opportunity Sharing Rules** section, click new -> ==create sharing rule==

###### Manager Group
If enabled, user can share records with their managers and managers subordinates groups.

### 5. Teams and Manual Sharing

###### Granting access and assigning roles to users who need to collaborate on a specific record
- Opportunity Teams
- Account Teams
- Case Teams

###### Manual Sharing
Temporary and flexible sharing set by the record owner

###### Security Layers #security

### 6. Restriction Rules
레코드에 대한 접근 제한
###### Restriction Rule 
이미 주어진 접근 권한에 제한을 걸고 record layer에서만 가능




###### Recap
OWD: access 관련 기본 설정  
Role Hierarchy: 수직 권한 설정(수평도 가능)  
Sharing Rules: 수평적 권한 설정  
Teams and Manual Sharing 유동성있게 권한 적용 - rule로 적용하기 어려울 때   
(admin 아니어도 record owner가 설정할 수 있음)
