Evaluate Before Constructing Your Org
1. Standard Functionality: Use- Start with standard functionality.
2. Declarative: Configure - If it doesn't exist, build it with clicks.
3. AppExchange
4. Programmatic
### Standard Object
#object
You can manage **Objects** at **Object Manager**    
Objects are analogous to database **tables**  
- Standard objects: pre-defined table
- Custom objects: we create

## 2. Standard and Custom Fields
#field
### 1) Standard Fields
You cannot delete them, but you can use field-level #security  to hide them, or remove them from page layouts if they are not required.   

It's predefined but you can customize ... #custom
- change the field label
- add help text
- add or edit values in picklists
- add or edit lookup filters
- set field history tracking

### 2) Custom Fields
New fields that you can create on any standard or custom object to capture additional information required for your business.

#### Data Loss When Editing and Deleting Custom Fields
Data loss considerations when changing field type:
- Field's data being lost
- List views based on the field will be deleted
- Assignment and escalation rules may be affected
- You should only modify fields with no data, or consider using new fields
- Deleting a field will also result in data loss

#### Creating a New Custom Field in Four Easy Steps
1. select Data Type
   currency, date checkbox, picklist, text
2. Enter Details
   label, length, picklist values, description, help text
3. Set Field-Level(FLS)  #security 
   visibility by profile, Editability by profile
4. add to Page Layout

#### Picklists
Picklists are fields that allow users to select either single or multiple values from **predefined list** during data entry.
- Speed up data entry
- Maintain ==data quality== by allowing only permissible values (data 일관성 유지)
- Facilitate ==searching==, ==reporting==, and ==filtering==

##### Dependent Picklists

## 3. Relationship Fields

#### Object Relationships
==Connects== two sets of data together.
- Look Up - Loosely Coupled
- Master-Detail -Tightly Coupled


##### Lookup Relationship Fields

Independent sharing settings - child and parent do not share permissions.  
A child record ==can exist without== a parent.  
When the ==parent is deleted==, you can ==choose== whether to clear the lookup field or prevent deletion.
