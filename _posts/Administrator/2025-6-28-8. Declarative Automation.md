## 3. Lead and Case Management

### 1) Automating **Leads**
#webtolead 
By adding a ==Web-to-Lead form== to your website, you can allow visitors to submit their info.  
When a form is submitted, Salesforce automatically creates a ==Lead record== with the provided data.

#### Preparation for Web-to-Lead
#webtolead
- Custom Fields
- Queues
  Locations where ==record== await processing by assigned members.  
  (Record를 처리할 담당자를 할당하기 위한 대기하는 곳)  
  When you create a queue, a view is automatically added to the object's ==list views==. #listiview

#### Auto-Response Rules
Lead/case auto-response rules respond to the web submission of leads or cases with a specific email, based on the criteria you specify within the rule.

#### Enabling Web-to-Lead and Creating the Web Form
Once you have enabled the feature, you can generate HTML for any lead or case field for use on your website.

#### Lead Conversion
When a ==lead== is converted by a ==users==,  
==lead fields== is inserted into standard ==account== and ==contact fields==.
Mapping fields to an opportunity object record is optional.


### 2) Automating **Cases**
By adding a Web-to-Case form, customers can submit support requests.  

Similar to lead automation.

## 4. Workflow and Process Builder

### Workflow Rules
(업무의 흐름 잘 실행되게끔 만드는 규칙)
Sets workflow ==actions== into motion when ==certain conditions are met==.  
Evaluation Criteria -> Rule Criteria -> Actions -> Time Triggers -> Actions
### Considerations for Workflow Actions
- Task: The only type of record Workflow can create.
- Field Updates: Can only update fields on ==target== or ==parent== object.
- Outbound Messages: Send information out of Salesforce to a designated endpoint like an external service.
### Process Builder
(요즘은 사용 잘 안함)
Lets you ==automate== business processes with multiple criteria nodes.
Create a record, update records, send email, post to chatter etc.
